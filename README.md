# STN/LCD Controller
VHDL implementation for generating required signals for a display module without dedicated controller.
There are two implementations available:

1. Based on the design made by **[Christopher Kratz]**, source and explanations available on http://burnt-traces.com
2. My own aproach regarding the matter, more formal, and more parametric for easier adaptation
